# TreeDudePython
My quick &amp; dirty version of TreeDude from Superhot. Which itself was an ASCII clone of Timberman on mobile app stores. Use A &amp; D to move left and right. You gain score by chopping trees. You lose the game by hitting a tree or running out of a time. R restarts on game over. Have Fun!
